# VQ-NeRV



This repository implements the training, testing and evaluation code for the "VQ-NeRV: A Vector Quantised Neural Representation for Videos" 

We will release codes after IJCAI 2024.

## Acknowledgement
Part of the implementation is based on the code from [HNeRV](https://github.com/haochen-rye/HNeRV/) and [vector-quantize-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/vector-quantize-pytorch).
